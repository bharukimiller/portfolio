A site for Human Right's First lawyers to be able to upload scans of asylum cases to the website, scraping data from cases automatically. The lawyers would filter through cases or identify trends through the data to the site. I worked to make the site more secure, and take the scraped data and make it available to the front end API as stringified JSON.
