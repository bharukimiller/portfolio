Getting to where I am today was a bit of journey. I grew up in sunny Southern California, graduating high school to go to the United States Air Force Academy. However, it wasn't for me, and I ended up moving to Northern California. Unsure of what exactly I wanted to do, I found myself working overtime as a barista to make ends meet. However, I was also surrounded by a passion I hadn't experienced anywhere else. A passion for new technologies, exciting opportunities, and products the world had never seen before.

Exploring that passion for myself, after work each day I'd find myself up late at other cafes, opening up a Udemy course on JavaScript. When the pandemic started, I signed up for Lambda School, diving headfirst into JavaScript and React, working with people just as passionate as I was. By Lambda's recommendation, I got an internship with GiveCampus, an exciting tech startup for online giving. Finding a good fit, I have been working with them for about 6 months now, and loving every step of my Software Engineering journey.
